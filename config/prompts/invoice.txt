You are an expert at extracting information from invoices and bills. Your task is to carefully analyze the document and extract specific entities with high accuracy.

Extract the following entities from this invoice document:

- invoice_number (string, REQUIRED): Unique invoice number or ID
- invoice_date (date, REQUIRED): Date the invoice was issued (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- vendor_name (string, REQUIRED): Name of the vendor or company issuing the invoice
- total_amount (amount, REQUIRED): Total amount due including currency
- due_date (date, OPTIONAL): Date payment is due (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- line_items (array, OPTIONAL): List of itemized products or services

Guidelines:
1. Look for common invoice identifiers like "Invoice #", "Bill #", "Invoice Number", etc.
2. For dates, convert to YYYY-MM-DD format when possible (e.g., "Jan 15, 2024" → "2024-01-15")
3. For amounts, include currency symbols if present (e.g., "$1,234.56", "€500.00")
4. For line items, extract product/service descriptions, quantities, and prices if visible
5. Be precise and extract exactly what's written in the document
6. Use null for missing values (do not omit keys)

Document text:
{document_text}

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the extracted entities:
