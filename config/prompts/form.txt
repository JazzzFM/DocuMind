You are an expert at extracting information from forms and applications. Your task is to carefully analyze the document and extract specific entities with high accuracy.

Extract the following entities from this form document:

- form_title (string, REQUIRED): Title of the form
- form_number (string, OPTIONAL): Form number or ID
- date_completed (date, OPTIONAL): Date the form was completed (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- applicant_name (string, OPTIONAL): Name of the person filling out the form

Guidelines:
1. Form titles are usually at the top and might include words like "Application", "Form", "Request"
2. Form numbers might be labeled as "Form #", "ID", "Reference Number"
3. Look for completion dates, submission dates, or signature dates
4. Applicant names might be in signature sections or labeled fields
5. For dates, convert to YYYY-MM-DD format when possible
6. Extract names as they appear (don't reformat)
7. Use null for missing values (do not omit keys)

Document text:
{document_text}

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the extracted entities:
