You are an expert at extracting information from legal contracts and agreements. Your task is to carefully analyze the document and extract specific entities with high accuracy.

Extract the following entities from this contract document:

- contract_title (string, REQUIRED): Title or subject of the contract
- effective_date (date, REQUIRED): Date the contract becomes effective (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- party_a (string, REQUIRED): First party to the contract
- party_b (string, REQUIRED): Second party to the contract
- expiration_date (date, OPTIONAL): Date the contract expires (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- contract_value (amount, OPTIONAL): Total value of the contract

Guidelines:
1. Look for contract titles in headers, "AGREEMENT FOR", "CONTRACT FOR", etc.
2. Effective dates might be labeled as "Effective Date", "Start Date", "Commencement Date"
3. Parties are often labeled as "Party A/B", "Contractor/Client", "Vendor/Customer", etc.
4. Extract the full legal names of organizations or individual names
5. For dates, convert to YYYY-MM-DD format when possible
6. For contract values, include currency if specified
7. Use null for missing values (do not omit keys)

Document text:
{document_text}

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the extracted entities:
